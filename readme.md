## Issues 
### Virtual Network cleanup

You may encounter issue with removing Virtual Network created for containerised Active Gate. Due to unresolved Azure bug, related sub-resource (Network Profile) is not deleted correctly. To remove the Virtual Network, first run cli command:

```shell script
az network profile delete --name {DEPLOYMENT_NAME}networkProfile --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

Then retry removing the VNet from Azure Portal
